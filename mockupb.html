        <h1>Mockup-B Weblab</h1>
        <p>This was an optional bonus project in Weblab to code a webpage from a Zeplin mockup. I decided that I wanted to try a few new tools to challenge myself so I attempted to implement sass and gulp on this project as well as make the webpage responsive. I had never coded with sass before and ended up loving how efficient it made my development process. It was pretty challenging for me to figure out how to get gulp running, but, after working through the issues and doing some research online, Iâ€™m so glad that I decided to try it out and am excited to keep using it in future projects. This was also my first attempt at responsive web development. I decided to implement a 12column grid. I also used a little bit of flex positioning. </p>
