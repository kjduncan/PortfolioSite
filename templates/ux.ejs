        <h1>UX/UI</h1>
        <p>The UX/UI section of Weblab was one of my favorite parts of the bootcamp. It was so interesting to learn about user experience and the importance of research and design. We learned some design principles and the importance of empathy and context in creating a positive user experience. We learned how to create empathy maps and customer journey maps. This section of Weblab ended with a group project where we had to develop a portion of an app that would be used by field agents collecting blood samples during the zombie apocalypse.  My group tackled the security section of the app, working through all of the issues associated with it, and creating an experience where our users could be successful. This project was a great way to get a taste for the research and development associated with user experience design. </p>
