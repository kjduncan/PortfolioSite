        <h1>Portfolio Site</h1>
        <p>This is a personal project that I created to display some of my work. I was really interested in parallax scrolling at the time and decided that I wanted to implement that feature using a jquery plugin. It was challenging for me to work through the process of implementing a plugin and getting it to work correctly within my site, but Iâ€™m so glad that I tried it and really like how it turned out. I also wanted to play around with some jquery click events and added some modal popups in my project gallery as well as the menu.  </p>
